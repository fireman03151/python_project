### Setup 

Refer to this [setup video](https://youtu.be/beEBeQw5tpc) to install the dependencies and generate API keys and incorporate with our applications. I've articulated the steps in text format here : 

- Install the dependencies following these steps : 

  - Star this repository (top right corner) 
  - <>Code > Download ZIP > Open cmd/terminal in that location
  - Run this command : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Replace API keys in `yml` files 

\* The setup for different projects might not be the same. Please refer to the individual setup guides given for each project.
